EGR 434 - Green Robotics, Automation, and Machine Intelligence (CS 434)
4.00 credits.
Cutting-edge innovations in robotics, automation, and machine Intelligence that result in the most environmentally-friendly and humanity-sensitive use of technology and resources to manufacture products or aid humans. Various forms of Machine Intelligence including Symbolic AI which uses programmed rules, heuristics, and forms of knowledge representation; and artificial neural networks which are connectionist computer architectures (hardware or software) where many computational nodes are connected to solve problems requiring rapid adaptation, or where governing equations are not known or cannot be easily computed. Mobile-robot and robotic-arm theory, applications, simulations, real-time control, and path-planning strategies are included. *Prerequisite(s): CS 121 and MA 121. Fall semester, odd-numbered years.
